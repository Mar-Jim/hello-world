Learning how to use github

I'm Marcelo Jimenez, a student at UT Austin studying Petroleum Engineering and 
I'm branching out into the world of software development to expand my knowledge
and have some fun.

This is my first ever repository and I'm exited to see what I'll do in my journey 
in coding, data analytics and combing these skills with my engineering degree.
